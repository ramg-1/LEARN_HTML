<!-- 
7..there are two main way to include image src 1.absolute path 2.relative path
8.absolute path:it is complete path in image from the root file system
9.it include the full url of the file system
10..it include the full url such like that protocol domain-name file path eg https://example.com/images/images.jpg
11.it is useful when image we want to display is hoisted to on a differaent domain and when you want to specifi exact path to the file
12.eg search in google any image copy the file path and paste in src it will display the image from the that domain
13.so if we want to display the hoidted or load image from differnt domain then we can use absolute path

14..now relative path
15.a relative path is a path that is relative to the location of the current html file
16.we use relative path to load images from our own domain or our file directory but not from external domain
17.in others word relative specifies the location of the image file realtive to the locaation of the html file
18.there are three cases of relative path when using relative to specify the locaation of image file
19.1)the image file present in the same directory as the html file
   1a-if image file present in the same directory then just write the name of thaat image file browser will look to the same directory and display the same image
20.2)the image file present in the sub directory relative to html file
    2a)if image file present in the sub directory then firstly write the folder name along with image name
21.3)the image file present in the parent directory relative to html file
   3a)when html file present in sub folder and image file present in parent folder then from subfolder to parent folder we use notation ../(dot/) it will move one level of hirarcy and point to parent folder to show the image we can name the image after ../__.png
   3ab)if same case html file is prsent in sub to sub folder then we will use ../../__.png
22.by relative path we can access any file in the system like.pdf etc.
23.What is the difference between absolute paths and relative paths in web development?

Absolute paths are used to specify the location of the image file relative to the location of the HTML file, while relative paths are used to load files from external domains.

Absolute paths always start with a forward slash, while relative paths do not.

Relative paths are used to specify the location of the image file relative to the location of the HTML file, while absolute paths are used to load files from external domains.

Absolute paths are always longer and more complex than relative paths.
24.Which of the following is the correct way to include the "image.png" file in the "index.html" file?

<img src="image.png">

<img src="../image.png">

<img src="../../image.png">

<img src="../../../image.png">

25.image tag is use to display on the webpage but what happen when image is not present on the relative folder and image url is incorrect by happenting this thing html file will not display any image or will empty file which wil decrese the user experience(suppose a user is reading content and they are seeing empty fiel of image it will damage their feeling) to avoiding this it is prefered that to use alt attribut afete the image fiel so if the image is not present or url is wrogn then alt text will display descrtiption about that image so that user will be about to know about the image
26.What does the "alt" attribute in an image tag in HTML provide?

A title for the image

An abbreviation for the image

The alignment of the image

An alternative text for the image
27.Assuming that we have created the following img element in our HTML page:

<img src="icon.png" alt="Icon Image">

What happens if the specified image is not present on the server?

The browser displays a broken image icon

The browser displays the "alt" text 'Icon Image' along with a broken image icon

The browser displays the text "image not found"

The browser ignores the "alt" attribute and displays nothing
